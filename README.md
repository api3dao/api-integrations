Repository for managing API integrations.

## Deployment management

### Generating a `airnode-feed` deployment

1. Run the script

```shell
pnpm generate-airnode-feed-deployment
```

2. Select the API.

```bash
$ ts-node src/config-generation/airnode-feed/generate-deployment.ts
? Select an API to create deployment: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   api-1
    api-2
    some-api
    ...
```

3. Select the deployment type.

```
? Select the deployment type: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   staging
    candidate
```

4. Deployment will be created under `./data/apis/<api-name>/deployments/<deployment_type>-deployments`.

### Managing deployments

- Deployment folder for the each API has the below structure:

```
.
├── active-deployments
└── candidate-deployments
    └── api3-20231101-airnode-feed.json
```

- Deployments names are created in this format: `api3-YYYYMMDD-airnode-feed.json` and there should be only one or no
  deployments under `candidate-deployments`.
- Once a `candidate-deployment` is deployed by the API provider, deployment under the `candidate-deployment` will be
  manually moved under `active-deployments`. `active-deployments` will be confirmed with CI scripts. If there is no
  heartbeat from the deployment, CI won't allow pushing changes to the repository.
- Deployments will identified by `airnode-feed` configuration file's hash.

#### Heartbeat

Airnode feed minutely log the below string and the string will be parsed and returned through an API for this repository
to check deployments.

```
${airnodeAddress} - ${stage} - ${airnodeFeedVersion} - ${currentTimestamp} - ${deploymentTimestamp} - ${airnodeFeedConfigHash} - ${heartbeatSignature}
```

Through the `airnodeFeedConfigHash` it will be possible to check if the correct deployment is deployed.

#### api-data.json

There is `api-data.json` file for each API provider in `data/apis/<api-name>/api-data.json` path. This file includes the
below information.

- `alias`: Unique alias used for API.
- `name`: Name of the API for public use.
- `airnode`: Airnode address of the API.
- `xpub`: Extended public key.
- `supportedFeedsInBatches`: Name of the data feeds in batches supported by API, seperated by OIS titles.
- `deploymentLocations`: Deployment locations where API provider deployed their Airnode feed to.
- `homepageUrl`: API provider's website's homepage URL.
- `verifiedBaseUrl`: URL where includes API provider's Airnode address in it's TXT records for people to be able to be
  confirm the Airnode address.
- `signedApiUrl`: URL for the Signed API deployed by the API provider.
- `productionSignedApiUrls`: URLs of the Signed APIs where Airnode feeds deployed by the API provider push data to.
- `stagingSignedApiUrl`: URL of the Signed API where staging Airnode feed deployed by the API provider push data to.

### Adding a new data feed

1. Create a blueprint for the feed using `pnpm add-blueprint`

```
> @api3/api-integrations@1.0.0 add-blueprint /home/m3/meto_ws/api3_ws/byog/PHASE-2.1/final/api-integrations

> ts-node src/config-generation/add-new-data-feed-blueprint.ts

✔ Write data feed's name: … SOMETHING/USD
✔ Select an API to create data feed: › nodary
✔ Select the OIS: › Nodary
✔ Write the value for the parameter "path" (leave empty to pass)": … /feed/latest
✔ Write the value for the parameter "name" (leave empty to pass)": … SOMETHING/USD
✔ Write post processing snippet for "SOMETHING/USD": … (response) => { return response.value }
```

2. Add data feed to the corresponding `supportedFeedsInBatches` in corresponding `api-data.json`
3. Run `pnpm sync-oises`
